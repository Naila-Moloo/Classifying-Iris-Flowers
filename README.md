# Classifying-Iris-Flowers
This is the code for my first mini ML project that uses a Support Vector Machines algorithm to classify iris flowers with a 97% accuracy rate! I followed along with a tutorial for this one using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, just for the sake of learning how to create and test a model.
